# Muhar (मुहर)

**A verifiable seal for exams.**

Muhar is a proposed open-source exam-integrity protocol inspired by Devcon 8 India's [“What Can Ethereum Do for India? The Exam Leak Challenge”](https://cfp.devcon.org/devcon8/talk/QB3PET/) workshop. Its purpose is to make the choice and release of an exam paper harder to manipulate and easier to investigate. It does not claim that a blockchain can stop a human who already knows a question from leaking it.

The operating model is **one accountable exam operator, independent checks on the critical steps, and public verification of recorded evidence**. Ethereum has a narrow job: anchor a frozen, signed exam commitment and transparency-log checkpoints before the future random draw. Question text, answer keys, candidate data, and release keys stay off-chain. No token, wallet for candidates, DAO, or new chain is required.

## First build

1. `muhar-draw`: a deterministic, independently verifiable draw from a synthetic question bank and published blueprint, using a future, signature-verified randomness-beacon round.
2. `muhar-log`: a signed append-only record with inclusion and consistency proofs, independent monitors, and a minimal Ethereum anchor.
3. `muhar verify`: one command that checks the inventory commitment, frozen rules, beacon proof, exact selected IDs, released paper content, log proofs, and anchor, reporting each claim separately. The first pilot reveals its entire synthetic bank after the mock exam.

The first real-world pilot should be a **low-stakes, one-centre, single-session digital mock exam** run with a willing college or coaching partner. Live question-paper custody, threshold release, centre devices, and printing require a separate security review and institutional agreement.
